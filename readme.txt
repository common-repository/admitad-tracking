== Description ==

If you want to increase sales of your goods or to attract additional users or customers, become an Admitad partner [https://www.admitad.com/en/aboard/](https://www.admitad.com/en/aboard/)

This plugin allows you to integrate quickly your WooCommerce shop with our CPA network.

Tracking is implemented through sending postback requests with order information from your server to the Admitad server. We ensure the safety of tracking by checking the private authorization key in requests on our side.

== Installation ==

To integrate your store you need to get the user ID and secret key here [https://developers.admitad.com/en/apps/](https://developers.admitad.com/en/apps/)
